# HamSandwich Lightning Fee Manager üö¶

Welcome to **HamSandwich's Lightning Autotuner**!  
This fee/routing engine dynamically optimizes Lightning Network channel fees using adaptive rules, peer stats, HTLC event telemetry, and (future) ML.  

**Caveat** : This was built mostly on an iPhone, and sometimes an iPad, using copeous amounts of ChatGPT, while navigating bedtimes and beer. Who knows what easter eggs it hides!!

## üßæ Tech debt

- Lots of giant functions to break up. Thats ChatGPT for you!
- Unecessary use of BoS to obtain channel balances (as I didnt know about lncli before)
- Depends on charge-lnd to run separately.
- Uses docker socket to interact DIRECTLY with lncli running on your lnd container (shudder). Seriously who would do that...

---

## üõ† Quickstart

1. **Edit `autotune/params.toml`**  
   This is your master config: channel mapping, limits, rules, smoothing, file paths.  
   See the [Params Config Guide](#params-config-guide) below.

2. **Run as Docker containers**  
   - One container runs the HTLC event capture (`htlc.py`).
   - One container runs the main fee manager (`main.py`) on your chosen schedule (default 30min).

   Example:
   
   ```bash
   docker build . -t autotune:v0.6
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dryrun.yml up -d
   ```

To just observe and gather EMA stats, update the docker compose to pass the flag `--ema-observe`.

3. **See logs and output**  
   - Fee config: `/app/chargelnd/config.toml`
   - State: `/app/data/peer_memory.json`
   - Logs: `/app/log/fee_adjust.log`, `/app/log/fee_changes.ndjson`

4. **charge-lnd**
   - Point charge-lnd at the config.toml

# - max_range_ppm: Hard upper bound
# - inbound_fee_ppm: Minimum positive inbound fee

min_range_ppm = 750
...

```

For every peer/channel, create a `[channels.X]` block.  
Optionally tweak `min_range_ppm`, `max_range_ppm` and `inbound_fee_ppm` for desired fee bounds. Or just let the script gradually/eventually figure it out

## ‚ö° How it works

- Captures real-time HTLC events and state, not just fwding history
- Calculates optimal fees based on activity, streaks, stuck/failures, role, and bound, using weighted rules.
- Log everything as NDJSON for easy ML or dashboard integration
- Modular rules engine (easy to add more heuristics)
- When <10% capacity, Freeze outbound fees and set negative inbound == the min_fee_ppm

---

## üß† ML-Readiness

- All metrics, events, and changes are logged for future supervised/unsupervised learning
- Next steps: export features (time series, lagged signals, streaks, fail ratios, liquidity gradients) and plug into an ML pipeline, Also, learn ML so I can do this!
